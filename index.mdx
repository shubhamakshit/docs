title: "Introduction"
description: "This project started way back in 2023 as pwdl. It was then merely a script for downloading segments using a loophole in pw's api. When it got pached we moved on to pwdlv2 in March, 2024. It was mostly haphazard code. pwdlv3 started in April, 2024 as is proudly growing ever since. "
