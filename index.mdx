title: "Introduction"
description: "This project started way back in 2023 as pwdl. It was then merely a script for downloading segments using a loophole in pw's api. When it got pached we moved on to pwdlv2 in March, 2024. It was mostly haphazard code. pwdlv3 started in April, 2024 as is proudly growing ever since. "

## Setting up

What you need

- A **Linux** or a **Windows** machine.
- A stable internet connection.
- **Admin** access shouls be avaiable for **Windows** for using one liner installation.

### Windows

Note that this works for **Windows 10\+** with **Admin access.**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shubhamakshit/pwdlv3_assets/main/dl.pwdlv3.ps1 | iex
```

### Linux

Linux : **This is the Way.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhamakshit/pwdlv3.git
cd pwdlv3
chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh -f # -f means ffmpeg ; (ffmpeg binary in PATH is given preference)
source ~/.bashrc
```

### First Steps

Even though the **Windows** and **Linux** post install scripts cnfigure the settings to some extent, you might want to have a look at the settings or as we say **preferences** stored in `prefrences.json`

```json preferences.json
{
  "cloudfront_id": "d1d34p8vz63oiq",
  "patched": false,
  "user_id": "temp",
  "user_update_index": -1,
  "os-info": "linux",
  "batch_name":"",
  "video_id":"",
  "tmpDir": "/tmp",
  "verbose": false,
  "ffmpeg": "",
  "mp4decrypt": "$script/bin/mp4decrypt",
  "webui-del-time": 45,
  "webui": true,
  "webui-port": "5000",
  "token": {
    "l": 1488
  }
}
```

<Accordion title="Prefrences " description="Only few important ones have been discussed below" icon="code" iconType="solid">
  <ParamField path="user_id" type="string">
    <Danger>
      set user_id as "no_acc" if you dont want Syncer features. To know more about Syncer click here.
    </Danger>
    This user_id  is the name of your account within the pwdl database.
  </ParamField>
  <ResponseField name="user_update_index" type="int">
    The current iteration of update that the user is in currently. Every time the user logins via pwdl cli, this index is incremented by one.

    <Info>
      Use \*\*-1 \*\*to force update the token from the database.
    </Info>
    <Warning>
      As of the latest update in penpencil api, only users who had purchased a course/batch can view them
    </Warning>
    <ResponseField name="batch_name" type="string" default='""'>
      Name of the batch that will be used to check if the token in valid/acceptable.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="video_id" type="string">
      Id of the video that will be used to check if the token in valid/acceptable.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="tmpDir" type="path:string">
      The default directory where temporary files will be stored. Default values are given as below

      **Linux: /tmp**

      **Windows: %temp%**

      <Update label="06/12/2025" description>
        As of today pwdl requires **ffmpeg** and **mp4decrypt** only. In past we had to depend on third party mpeg-dash downloaders like **vsd** or **nm3**.
      </Update>
      <Info>
        Tip: you can use `pwdl-variables` for more granular control

        - `$script` : The roor folder of pwdlv3
        - `$home` : The home folder (equivalent to **~** in linux)
      </Info>
      **mp4decrypt** is mostly installed by the post install script hence the default value of `$script/bin/mp4decrypt`

      <ResponseField name="webui-del-time" type="int:minutes" default="45">
        If a download is requested by webui after this mcuh amountof time the all older files are deleted to conserve space.
      </ResponseField>
    </ResponseField>
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="webui-port" type="int:port" default="5000">
    The webui will start at this port
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="token" type="object" required>
    A valid token is required for pwdl to function. use flag `--ignore-token`  to bypass it
  </ResponseField>
