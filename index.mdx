title: "Introduction"
description: "This project started way back in 2023 as pwdl. It was then merely a script for downloading segments using a loophole in pw's api. When it got pached we moved on to pwdlv2 in March, 2024. It was mostly haphazard code. pwdlv3 started in April, 2024 as is proudly growing ever since. "

## Setting up

What you need

- A **Linux** or a **Windows** machine.
- A stable internet connection.
- **Admin** access shouls be avaiable for **Windows** for using one liner installation.

### Windows

Note that this works for **Windows 10\+** with **Admin access.**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shubhamakshit/pwdlv3_assets/main/dl.pwdlv3.ps1 | iex
```

### Linux

Linux : **This is the Way.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhamakshit/pwdlv3.git
cd pwdlv3
chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh -f # -f means ffmpeg ; (ffmpeg binary in PATH is given preference)
source ~/.bashrc
```

### First Steps

Even though the **Windows** and **Linux** post install scripts cnfigure the settings to some extent, you might want to have a look at the settings or as we say **prefrences** stored in `prefrences.json`

```json prefrences.json
{
  "cloudfront_id": "d1d34p8vz63oiq",
  "patched": false,
  "user_id": "temp",
  "user_update_index": -1,
  "os-info": "linux",
  "batch_name":"",
  "video_id":"",
  "tmpDir": "/tmp",
  "verbose": false,
  "vsd": "$script/bin/vsd",
  "ffmpeg": "",
  "mp4decrypt": "$script/bin/mp4decrypt",
  "webui-del-time": 45,
  "webui": true,
  "webui-port": "5000",
  "token": {
    "l": 1488
  }
}
```
